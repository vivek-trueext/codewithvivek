                <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Brendan Eich first developed JavaScript, a computer language, in about ten days in May 1995. The
                    language, formerly known as Mocha, later modified to LiveScript, and is now known simply as
                    JavaScript,
                    was created to be used on the client-side of websites, enabling the addition of dynamic and
                    interactive
                    components to static HTML texts.

                    JavaScript was initially implemented in Netscape Navigator, which was the most popular browser at
                    the
                    time. The language was quickly adopted by Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer. Due to its
                    simplicity
                    of usage and the fact that it was the only client-side scripting language available at the time,
                    JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers.</p>

                    <div class="faqContent">
                        <p>JavaScript has six primitive data types:Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
                            It also has two compound data types:Object,Array.
                            JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side
                            that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give
                            structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that
                            engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search
                            box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter
                            feed.</p>

                    <div class="faqContent">
                        <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript concept that refers to the process of moving declarations to the top
                            of
                            their scope. This means that variables and functions can be used before they are declared,
                            as
                            long as they are declared before they are used in a function.

                            For example, the following code will print "Hello, world!" even though the greeting variable
                            is
                            not declared until after the console.log() statement.</p>

                    <div class="faqContent">
                        <p>The word “debugger” is used in JavaScript to refer to a tool that can be used to step through
                            JavaScript code line by line. This can be helpful for debugging JavaScript code, which is
                            the
                            process of finding and fixing errors in JavaScript code. To use the debugger, you need to
                            open
                            the JavaScript console in your browser. Then, you can use debugger commands to comb through
                            your
                            code line by line.

                            It's essential to know debugging techniques as well as the more general ideas behind code
                            optimization and speed improvement. In addition to operating smoothly, efficient code
                            significantly enhances the user experience.</p>

                <h2>Vision of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Computer Vision in JavaScript allows your web application to process images in order to gain
                    high-level understanding from digital images or videos. This could involve tasks like identifying
                    objects, detecting and recognizing faces, categorizing scenes, and even building a 3D model of an
                    object.The advantage of using JavaScript is that it allows real-time image processing directly in
                    the user's browser, making applications more interactive and responsive.
                    <br>
                    There are many resources for exploring the capabilities available to JavaScript, including several
                    online tools. Click here to upload and analyze an Image Online — This online tool will demonstrate
                    JavaScript ability to detect objects, and describe images within your web browser.
                    <br>
                    Using computer vision with JavaScript, developers can build a variety of applications ranging from
                    automated surveillance systems that can identify unauthorized access, to e-commerce apps that let
                    users virtually try on clothes or makeup. Similarly, social media sites can use it to automatically
                    tag people in photos, and self-driving cars can use it to interpret road signs.

                <p><b>Web Development</b> <br>
                    JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows
                    developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute
                    complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire
                    page. Most websites use JavaScript for validation and to support external applications, including
                    PDF documents, widgets, flash applications. Some of the world's largest tech companies use
                    JavaScript to better the user experience.

                    Some famous websites built by the use of JavaScript are Google, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo,
                    Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and LinkedIn, to name a few. <br>
                    <b>Web Applications</b> <br>
                    Various JavaScript frameworks are used for developing and building robust web applications. In an
                    application like Google Maps, if users want to explore a map, all they have to do is click and drag
                    the mouse to get a detailed view. This is powered by JavaScript, which interacts with the browser
                    without communicating with the servers. Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks that help build web
                    apps are React Native, React, Angular and Vue. Netflix and PayPal were developed with AngularJS
                    JavaScript framework and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
